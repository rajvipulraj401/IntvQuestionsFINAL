# --------------------- Follow Need what HOW ?-------------

## **(A)** Basic and core cocncept (_aSK on 16th april_)

### Q1) What is React?

**Ans :--**

---

**Need (Why do we need React?)**

When we build small websites, HTML, CSS, and JS (or even jQuery) are enough.
But when the application becomes large and complex, these traditional methods become harder to manage like we have to create same kind of ui again and again and creating that kind of website using core technologies becomes very messy and it is even harder to maintain.
So thats why we have front end library and framework and one such library is react .

**What (What is React?)**----

So, React is an open source front end **JavaScript library** which is used to build **user interfaces**, especially for **single-page applications**. It is helpful
in building complex application as it follows the component based approach and divides the whole page into small reusable components and makes it **easy to update just the parts that changes** without refreshing the whole page.

Some key features of react are :-

1. React uses jsx syntax (whuch combines js and Html)
2. It uses virtual dom instead of Real DOM
3. It follows unidirectional from paret to child which simplify the data management.
4. It supports server side rendering which is useful for Seo.

## 📺 Sir can I share my screen to show this with an example

🖥 _Let me share my screen and show you how a simple React component looks like:_

```jsx
// App.js
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  const name = "React";

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
      <p>This is a basic React component using JSX.</p>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

<!-- ---

--------------------------------2-----

--- -->

### Q2) What is JSX?

Ans :--

---

**Need (Why do we need JSX?)**

whenever we build React apps, we need to mix **HTML and JavaScript** to show dynamic data in the UI.  
and earlier we had to do that using `document.createElement()` which was **complex and less readable** . So inorder To solve this problem, **React introduced JSX** .

---

**What (What exactly is JSX?)**

JSX stands for **JavaScript XML**. It allows us to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript and place them in the Dom without using functions like **append child** or **create element**
Basically it just provide us the syntatic sugar for the `react. createElement (types, props , ..children)` and it makes the code more readable and expressive by combining JavaScript expressions
with an HTML-like template syntax .

`EXTRA dont speak`
But JSX doesn’t work directly in the browser — React converts it behind the scenes to `React.createElement()` calls.
In short — JSX makes React code **look like HTML**, but it’s still JavaScript.

---

**How (How do we use JSX and what are the rules?)**

some important **rules** OF JSX that we need to follow are:

1. **All JSX tags must be closed**, even self-closing ones.

for eg:--

```jsx
<img src="logo.png" /> // ✅ valid in JSX
```

2. **All Attribute nameing should be in camelCase**.

   - Use `className` instead of `class`
   - Use `onClick` instead of `onclick`

3. **Use curly braces `{}` to write JS expressions inside JSX**.

   ```jsx
   const name = "React";
   <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;
   ```

4. **JSX should only return one parent element so Wrap multiple elements inside one parent** (either a `<div>` or a React fragment `<>...</>`).
   ```jsx
   return (
     <>
       <h1>Hello</h1>
       <p>World</p>
     </>
   );
   ```

---

## 📺 Sir can I share my screen to show this with an example

🖥 Sir let me share my screen and show a small example of how JSX works in React.

```jsx
// App.js
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  const username = "Crio Learner";

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello {username}</h1>
      <p>This is JSX in action inside a React component.</p>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Q3) What is Virtual DOM in React?

Ans :--

---

when we make any web application using the core technologies and in the websites there are many parts that keep changing — like when we type, click buttons, or get new data from the server.then for the websites created using just the core-technologies re -renderes the DOM for every small changes we do in our ui and the whole page is painted again and again so in turn it makes our big application **slow and inefficient**
and in order To solve this problem, React team introduced the concept of **Virtual DOM**.

---

**What (What exactly is Virtual DOM?)**

Virtual DOM is a **lightweight in-memory virtual representaion of the real Dom** . (it's not actual copy of DOM ) .
It is kept inside the memory and it is synced with the real DOM ( by a library called react DOM).

---

**How (How does React use Virtual DOM?)**

Now let's understand how this exactly works .

1. When state or props of our component changes then react creates a new Virtual DOM in memory and then it compares it with the old virtual dom adn finds the difference part of it
2. and then instead of re -rendering the entire DOM react only updates the difference part inside the real dom.
3. This comparison of old and new version of virtual Dom is called **diffing** which is short for Diffing algoritm
   and This whole whole process is known as **Reconciliation process**.

   and using this process we **efficiently and quickly update our web applications** which makes our app **fast and smooth**.

---

## 📺 Sir can I share my screen to show this with an example

🖥 Sir let me share my screen and show how React uses Virtual DOM in action.

```jsx
// App.js
import React, { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, when we click the button:

- Only the `<h1>` tag gets updated,
- React does not reload or re-render the full page.
- This is because of Virtual DOM and the efficient update it handles behind the scenes.

<!-- ---4--------

--- -->

4. What is the difference between Virtual DOM and Real DOM in React?

Ans :--

1. DOM stands for Document Object Model, and it is a tree-like structure that the browser creates from an HTML page. For example, when we create any element in HTML, that element becomes a part of this DOM tree.
   while the virtual dom is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real dom It is only kept inside the memory and is synced with the real dom .

2. Also when we update the dom directly it is actually very slow as the browser needs to re-render the entire DOM tree On the other hand, updating the Virtual DOM is much faster because React only updates the parts that have actually changed — this process is called reconciliation. which uses the diffing algorith to compare the two virtual dom and only updates the real dom with the change part.

3. The third difference is that we can directly manipulate the Real DOM using JavaScript do crud operation in dom (like adding, removing, or updating elements). But we cannot directly change the Virtual DOM — it is managed internally by React using the **react-dom** library.

### Q5) What is Reconciliation in React?

Ans :--

---

**Need (Why do we need Reconciliation?)**

In React apps, when data changes (like state or props), the UI should also update.  
But we don’t want to update the whole page unnecessarily and re-render the enire dom and in order to prevent that we have a process in react known as reconcilliation process.

---

**What (What exactly is Reconciliation?)**

**Reconciliation** is the process by which React **compares the old Virtual DOM with the new Virtual DOM**, and it finds the actual difference to update in ral dom , and then updates only those changed parts in the real DOM.

---

**How (How does Reconciliation work?)**

Now let's understand how this exactly works .

1. When state or props of our component changes then react creates a new Virtual DOM in memory and then it compares it with the old virtual dom adn finds the difference part of it
2. and then instead of re -rendering the entire DOM react only updates the difference part inside the real dom.
3. This comparison of old and new version of virtual Dom is called **diffing** which is short for Diffing algoritm
   and This whole whole process is known as **Reconciliation process**.

   and using this process we **efficiently and quickly update our web applications** which makes our app **fast and smooth**.

---

🧠 Extra Point (for follow-up or bonus)

React uses **keys** (especially in lists) to help in reconciliation. Keys help React identify which items changed, added, or removed.

---

## 📺 Sir can I share my screen to show this with an example?

🖥 Let me show a small demo of how React efficiently updates only the changed part.

```jsx
// App.js
import React, { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <h2> hello World </h2>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example:

- Every time we click the button, React creates a new virtual DOM.
- It compares it with the old one.
- Finds that only the `<h1>` text changed.
- So it updates only that part — not the whole page.

This is how reconciliation process keeps Application made in React fast and efficient 🔥

6. What is the need of ReactJS if we already have HTML, CSS, JS, or jQuery?

Ans :---

When we build small websites, HTML, CSS, and JS (or even jQuery) are enough.
But when the application becomes large and complex, these traditional methods become harder to manage like we have to create same kind of ui again and again and creating that kind of website using core technologies becomes very messy and it is even harder to maintain.

1. React uses jsx syntax (whuch combines js and Html)
2. It uses virtual dom instead of Real DOM .
3. It follows unidirectional from paret to child which simplify the data management.
4. It supports server side rendering which is useful for Seo.
5. It make use of reusable component instead of creating same component again and again we can make use of one
   component and pass props to make it change little bit or even use children props to make that component as a wrapper.

6. It provides hooks to manage state management in react and it is very easy to do that in react as compare to in core technologies.

Your answer is good and has the right intention! You're explaining **why React is useful** when HTML, CSS, JS, or jQuery aren't enough. But to make it more **polished, professional, and interview-ready**, let's clean it up a bit — while keeping your conversational style intact.

---

`Extra DO NOT say`

1. **JSX Syntax**

   - React uses JSX, which allows us to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. It makes the code easier to read and write, especially for building UI components.

2. **Virtual DOM**

   - React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update only the parts of the UI that change, instead of re-rendering the entire page like traditional methods.

3. **Component-Based Architecture**

   - Instead of writing the same HTML again and again, we can create **reusable components** and use them wherever needed. We can pass **props** to customize them or even use **children** props to make wrapper components.

4. **Unidirectional Data Flow**

   - React follows a one-way data binding (from parent to child), which makes the data flow predictable and easier to debug.

5. **State Management with Hooks**

   - Managing state is much easier in React using **Hooks** like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc. This simplifies logic that would otherwise be complex in plain JS or jQuery.

6. **Support for Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
   - With frameworks like Next.js (built on React), we can enable SSR which helps in better SEO and performance.

---

### 🧠 Summary:

React is needed not because HTML/CSS/JS are not capable — but because **React makes it easier to manage and scale modern web applications** with better structure, performance, and maintainability.

### Q7) what is a singlepage application ?

Ans:--
**Need? ---**
whenever we build a website or a project, we need to implement multiple pages. Usually, websites have different sections, like in a **navbar**, where we see different options linking to various pages.
and In a traditional **Multi-Page Application (MPA)**, clicking on a link reloads the entire page, which slows down performance. This happens because every time we navigate to a different page, the browser fetches and loads a completely new HTML file.

This makes our application slower and in order to solve this, **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** were introduced .

**What is an SPA?**

A Single Page Application is a web application where we have only **one main HTML file**, and all other content is dynamically loaded inside it without refreshing the page.

So, instead of loading new HTML pages from the server, it uses JavaScript (React, Angular, etc.) to dynamically update specific sections, which makes our app faster.

**How do we handle multiple pages inside an SPA?**

So in order to achieve routing inside our spa we use **React Router** , which is a library in React that allows us to create multiple sections (or views) within the same page. like for example we have a navbar and we have different pages linked inside our navbar and we can then make use of react router library and define all the application inside the **<>Browser Router** component provided by React router and then make use of **Routes and Route component**
and specify the Route we want to link our component and using the **<Link>** component we can link our component to different pages and it does not reload our whole page **like anchor tag <a>** instead , it just updates the view by changing the route.

So this way we just make use of Single page application with just one html file and still have multiple pages linked to our single page application.

---

---

### 📺 Sir, can I show an example?

🖥 Let me share my screen and show how a React SPA switches between routes without reloading the page using React Router.

```jsx
// App.js
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";

const Home = () => <h2>Home Page</h2>;
const About = () => <h2>About Page</h2>;

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link> | <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </nav>

      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

> When you click “About”, React loads the new component **without reloading the page** — that’s a SPA behavior.
