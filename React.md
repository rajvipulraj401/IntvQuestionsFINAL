# **(A)** Basic and core cocncept (_aSK on 16th april_)

## Q1) What is React?

**Ans :--**

---

### **Need (Why do we need React?)**

When we build small websites, HTML, CSS, and JS (or even jQuery) are enough.
But when the application becomes large and complex, these traditional methods become harder to manage like we have to create same kind of ui again and again and creating that kind of website using core technologies becomes very messy and it is even harder to maintain.
So thats why we have front end library and framework and one such library is react .

### **What (What is React?)**----

So, React is an open source front end **JavaScript library** which is used to build **user interfaces**, especially for **single-page applications**. It is helpful
in building complex application as it follows the component based approach and divides the whole page into small reusable components and makes it **easy to update just the parts that changes** without refreshing the whole page.

Some key features of react are :-

1. React uses jsx syntax (whuch combines js and Html)
2. It uses virtual dom instead of Real DOM
3. It follows unidirectional from paret to child which simplify the data management.
4. It supports server side rendering which is useful for Seo.

### 📺 Sir can I share my screen to show this with an example

🖥 _Let me share my screen and show you how a simple React component looks like:_

```jsx
// App.js
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  const name = "React";

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
      <p>This is a basic React component using JSX.</p>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

<!-- ---

--------------------------------2-----

--- -->

## Q2) What is JSX?

Ans :--

---

### **Need (Why do we need JSX?)**

whenever we build React apps, we need to mix **HTML and JavaScript** to show dynamic data in the UI.  
and earlier we had to do that using `document.createElement()` which was **complex and less readable** . So inorder To solve this problem, **React introduced JSX** .

---

### **What (What exactly is JSX?)**

JSX stands for **JavaScript XML**. It allows us to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript and place them in the Dom without using functions like **append child** or **create element**
Basically it just provide us the syntatic sugar for the `react. createElement (types, props , ..children)` and it makes the code more readable and expressive by combining JavaScript expressions
with an HTML-like template syntax .

`EXTRA dont speak`
But JSX doesn’t work directly in the browser — React converts it behind the scenes to `React.createElement()` calls.
In short — JSX makes React code **look like HTML**, but it’s still JavaScript.

---

**How (How do we use JSX and what are the rules?)**

some important **rules** OF JSX that we need to follow are:

1. **All JSX tags must be closed**, even self-closing ones.

for eg:--

```jsx
<img src="logo.png" /> // ✅ valid in JSX
```

2. **All Attribute nameing should be in camelCase**.

   - Use `className` instead of `class`
   - Use `onClick` instead of `onclick`

3. **Use curly braces `{}` to write JS expressions inside JSX**.

   ```jsx
   const name = "React";
   <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;
   ```

4. **JSX should only return one parent element so Wrap multiple elements inside one parent** (either a `<div>` or a React fragment `<>...</>`).
   ```jsx
   return (
     <>
       <h1>Hello</h1>
       <p>World</p>
     </>
   );
   ```

---

### 📺 Sir can I share my screen to show this with an example

```jsx
// App.js
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  const username = "Crio Learner";

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello {username}</h1>
      <p>This is JSX in action inside a React component.</p>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Q3) What is Virtual DOM in React?

Ans :--

---

### **need**

when we make any web application using the core technologies and in the websites there are many parts that keep changing — like when we type, click buttons, or get new data from the server.then for the websites created using just the core-technologies re -renderes the DOM for every small changes we do in our ui and the whole page is painted again and again so in turn it makes our big application **slow and inefficient**
and in order To solve this problem, React team introduced the concept of **Virtual DOM**.

---

### **What (What exactly is Virtual DOM?)**

Virtual DOM is a **lightweight in-memory virtual representaion of the real Dom** . (it's not actual copy of DOM ) .
It is kept inside the memory and it is synced with the real DOM ( by a library called react DOM).

---

### **How (How does React use Virtual DOM?)**

Now let's understand how this exactly works .

1. When state or props of our component changes then react creates a new Virtual DOM in memory and then it compares it with the old virtual dom adn finds the difference part of it
2. and then instead of re -rendering the entire DOM react only updates the difference part inside the real dom.
3. This comparison of old and new version of virtual Dom is called **diffing** which is short for Diffing algoritm
   and This whole whole process is known as **Reconciliation process**.

   and using this process we **efficiently and quickly update our web applications** which makes our app **fast and smooth**.

---

### 📺 Sir can I share my screen to show this with an example

```jsx
// App.js
import React, { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, when we click the button:

- Only the `<h1>` tag gets updated,
- React does not reload or re-render the full page.
- This is because of Virtual DOM and the efficient update it handles behind the scenes.

<!-- ---4--------

--- -->

## 4. What is the difference between Virtual DOM and Real DOM in React?

Ans :--

1. DOM stands for Document Object Model, and it is a tree-like structure that the browser creates from an HTML page. For example, when we create any element in HTML, that element becomes a part of this DOM tree.
   while the virtual dom is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real dom It is only kept inside the memory and is synced with the real dom .

2. Also when we update the dom directly it is actually very slow as the browser needs to re-render the entire DOM tree On the other hand, updating the Virtual DOM is much faster because React only updates the parts that have actually changed — this process is called reconciliation. which uses the diffing algorith to compare the two virtual dom and only updates the real dom with the change part.

3. The third difference is that we can directly manipulate the Real DOM using JavaScript do crud operation in dom (like adding, removing, or updating elements). But we cannot directly change the Virtual DOM — it is managed internally by React using the **react-dom** library.

<!-----

  ---------5--------

--- -->

## Q5) What is Reconciliation in React?

Ans :--

---

### **Need (Why do we need Reconciliation?)**

In React apps, when data changes (like state or props), the UI should also update.  
But we don’t want to update the whole page unnecessarily and re-render the enire dom and in order to prevent that we have a process in react known as reconcilliation process.

---

### **What (What exactly is Reconciliation?)**

**Reconciliation** is the process by which React **compares the old Virtual DOM with the new Virtual DOM**, and it finds the actual difference to update in ral dom , and then updates only those changed parts in the real DOM.

---

### **How (How does Reconciliation work?)**

Now let's understand how this exactly works .

1. When state or props of our component changes then react creates a new Virtual DOM in memory and then it compares it with the old virtual dom adn finds the difference part of it
2. and then instead of re -rendering the entire DOM react only updates the difference part inside the real dom.
3. This comparison of old and new version of virtual Dom is called **diffing** which is short for Diffing algoritm
   and This whole whole process is known as **Reconciliation process**.

   and using this process we **efficiently and quickly update our web applications** which makes our app **fast and smooth**.

---

🧠 Extra Point (for follow-up or bonus)

React uses **keys** (especially in lists) to help in reconciliation. Keys help React identify which items changed, added, or removed.

---

### 📺 Sir can I share my screen to show this with an example?

```jsx
// App.js
import React, { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <h2> hello World </h2>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example:

- Every time we click the button, React creates a new virtual DOM.
- It compares it with the old one.
- Finds that only the `<h1>` text changed.
- So it updates only that part — not the whole page.

This is how reconciliation process keeps Application made in React fast and efficient 🔥

## 6. What is the need of ReactJS if we already have HTML, CSS, JS, or jQuery?

Ans :---

When we build small websites, HTML, CSS, and JS (or even jQuery) are enough.
But when the application becomes large and complex, these traditional methods become harder to manage like we have to create same kind of ui again and again and creating that kind of website using core technologies becomes very messy and it is even harder to maintain.
So thats why we have front end library and framework and one such library is react .

Some key features of react are :-

1. React uses jsx syntax (whuch combines js and Html)
2. It uses virtual dom instead of Real DOM .
3. It follows unidirectional from paret to child which simplify the data management.
4. It supports server side rendering which is useful for Seo.
5. It make use of reusable component instead of creating same component again and again we can make use of one
   component and pass props to make it change little bit or even use children props to make that component as a wrapper.

6. It provides hooks to manage state management in react and it is very easy to do that in react as compare to in core technologies.

Your answer is good and has the right intention! You're explaining **why React is useful** when HTML, CSS, JS, or jQuery aren't enough. But to make it more **polished, professional, and interview-ready**, let's clean it up a bit — while keeping your conversational style intact.

---

`Extra DO NOT say`

1. **JSX Syntax**

   - React uses JSX, which allows us to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. It makes the code easier to read and write, especially for building UI components.

2. **Virtual DOM**

   - React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update only the parts of the UI that change, instead of re-rendering the entire page like traditional methods.

3. **Component-Based Architecture**

   - Instead of writing the same HTML again and again, we can create **reusable components** and use them wherever needed. We can pass **props** to customize them or even use **children** props to make wrapper components.

4. **Unidirectional Data Flow**

   - React follows a one-way data binding (from parent to child), which makes the data flow predictable and easier to debug.

5. **State Management with Hooks**

   - Managing state is much easier in React using **Hooks** like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc. This simplifies logic that would otherwise be complex in plain JS or jQuery.

6. **Support for Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
   - With frameworks like Next.js (built on React), we can enable SSR which helps in better SEO and performance.

---

### 🧠 Summary:

React is needed not because HTML/CSS/JS are not capable — but because **React makes it easier to manage and scale modern web applications** with better structure, performance, and maintainability.

## Q7) what is a singlepage application ?

Ans:--

### **Need? ---**

whenever we build a website or a project, we need to implement multiple pages. Usually, websites have different sections, like in a **navbar**, where we see different options linking to various pages.
and In a traditional **Multi-Page Application (MPA)**, clicking on a link reloads the entire page, which slows down performance. This happens because every time we navigate to a different page, the browser fetches and loads a completely new HTML file.

This makes our application slower and in order to solve this, **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** were introduced .

### **What is an SPA?**

A Single Page Application is a web application where we have only **one main HTML file**, and all other content is dynamically loaded inside it without refreshing the page.

So, instead of loading new HTML pages from the server, it uses JavaScript (React, Angular, etc.) to dynamically update specific sections, which makes our app faster.

### **How do we handle multiple pages inside an SPA?**

So in order to achieve routing inside our spa we use **React Router** , which is a library in React that allows us to create multiple sections (or views) within the same page. like for example we have a navbar and we have different pages linked inside our navbar and we can then make use of react router library and define all the application inside the **<>Browser Router** component provided by React router and then make use of **Routes and Route component**
and specify the Route we want to link our component and using the **<Link>** component we can link our component to different pages and it does not reload our whole page **like anchor tag <a>** instead , it just updates the view by changing the route.

So this way we just make use of Single page application with just one html file and still have multiple pages linked to our single page application.

---

### 📺 Sir can I share my screen to show this with an example?

```jsx
// App.js
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";

const Home = () => <h2>Home Page</h2>;
const About = () => <h2>About Page</h2>;

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link> | <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </nav>

      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

> When you click “About”, React loads the new component **without reloading the page** — that’s a SPA behavior.

---

<!-----

  ---------8--------

--- -->

### **2️⃣ Difference between SPA vs Traditional Multi-Page Application (MPA) is that **

🔴 **in Traditional Multi-Page Application (MPA)**

- Every interaction (e.g., clicking a link) **triggers a full-page reload** from the server.
- and hence the application becomes Slower because the entire page reloads every time.

✅ **while in Single Page Application (SPA)**

- Only **relevant content** gets updates, and not the whole page is updated hence it makes our application Faster and gives smooth user experience.

---

### **3️⃣ some Examples of webiste made from SPAs are**

- Gmail
- Facebook
- Twitter etc

--- IntvAns ends here ----------------------------------------

### **4️⃣ Benefits of SPAs**

✔ **Faster Performance** – No full-page reloads, only necessary data updates.  
✔ **Better User Experience** – Feels more like a mobile app.  
✔ **Reduced Server Load** – Fewer requests since only data is fetched, not entire pages.

---

### **5️⃣ Drawbacks of SPAs**

❌ **SEO Challenges** – Since content is loaded dynamically, search engines may struggle to index it.  
❌ **Initial Load Time** – The first load can be slow because all scripts are downloaded at once.  
❌ **Browser Back/Forward Issues** – Requires extra handling for navigation since the page doesn’t reload.

# **(b)** _Class-based Components (Legacy React)_

## Q8) What is `super` in class components in ReactJS?

Ans :------

### #✅ **Need (Why do we use `super`?)**

When we create a class component in React, it extends from `React.Component` , which means our class inherits methods and properties from `React.Component`. So to properly initialize this inheritance, we need to call the parent class's constructor using `super() keyword`.

---

### #**What is `super`?**

`super` is a method in JavaScript that is used to **call the constructor of the parent class**. In the case of React class components, `super` method is used inside the constructor to call the constructor of `React.Component` which itself is a class and we want to inherit its property, which will enable us to access the `this` keyword and initialize state and props correctly to our component.

If we don’t do that, we’ll get an error — and we won’t be able to use `this.props` or set the state properly.

---

### #**How is `super` used?**

In a React class component, the `super()` method must be called before using `this keyword` inside the constructor. If we need to access `this.props` inside the constructor, we must call `super(props) method` to initialize the component properly.

---

### 📺 Sir can I share my screen to show this with an example?

#### **Example – Using `super` in a Class Component**

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props); // Calling parent constructor
    this.state = { message: "Hello, World!" };
  }

  render() {
    return <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>;
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

#### **4) Explanation of the Example**

- We **extend `React.Component`** → So we must call `super()`.
- If we use `this.state` inside the constructor, we need `super()` first.
- If we need to access `this.props` inside the constructor, we must use `super(props)`.

---

**Extras :---**

#### ✅ **What happens if we don’t use `super()`?**

If we try to use `this keyword` before calling `super() method`, React will throw an error:  
❌ **"Must call super constructor in derived class before accessing 'this' or returning from derived constructor"**

---

#### ✅ **Conclusion**

In short, `super method` is essential in React class components to call the parent class (`React.Component`) constructor and properly initialize the component before using `this`keyword and setting the state of the new component.

## 9. What are the lifecycle methods in React?

Ans:--

### **Need? -----------**

In React, components go through a series of stages during their life cycle — from creation to removal. and These stages require different actions to be taken, like fetching data or updating the UI. So in order to manage these stages React provides us **lifecycle methods** , which heps us to control the component behavior during its life.

### **What are Lifecycle Methods? -----------**

Component life cycle method refers to the different stages or phases a component has to go throughout its lifetime.

The component life cycle method can be broken down into three parts:

1. **Number one is mounting** – Mounting occurs when the component is first rendered to the DOM. Life cycle methods like `componentDidMount` are executed during this phase.

2. **Second is updating phase** – This phase occurs when the component is re-rendered or updated either when the **state or props** of the component changes.

   - This phase includes lifecycle methods such as `shouldComponentUpdate`, `render`, and `componentDidUpdate`.

3. **Lastly, we have the unmounting phase** – This phase occurs when the component is removed from the DOM, and this phase includes lifecycle methods like `componentWillUnmount`.

### 🧠 Functional Components Note:-------

Functional components do not have traditional lifecycle methods. Instead, they use the **`useEffect()`** hook to handle side effects and lifecycle behavior like mounting, updating, and unmounting.

### **How are these methods used in React? -----------**

### 📺 Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
    console.log("constructor called");
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, nextState) {
    console.log("getDerivedStateFromProps called");
    return null; // Used for state updates from props
  }

  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    console.log("shouldComponentUpdate called");
    return true; // Return false to prevent re-rendering
  }

  render() {
    console.log("render called");
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.count}</h1>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Increment
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("componentDidMount called");
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    console.log("componentDidUpdate called");
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    console.log("componentWillUnmount called");
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

> The console will log the lifecycle methods at each phase, showing when the component mounts, updates, and unmounts.

## 10. How can you pass data from parent component to child component?

**Ans :--**

### **Need** (Why do we need to pass data from parent to child?)

When we create any application using react we often divide our UI into reusable component like when we want to create a button and we want to use that button in several other section in our react application and in order to use that small component in several other place that **component need some data so that that component can be reused** again and again and so as in react we can only send data in unidirectional way so a parent has to send its **data in the form of props** .

---

### **What is it**

#### What does it mean to pass data to child?

In React, **"props" (short for properties)** are used to pass data from a **parent components to child components**.  
This is a **unidirectional data flow**, meaning data can only move from parent component to child component and not the other way . Also Props are **read-only**, which means a component receiving props **cannot modify them directly**. and only the parent component which is sending the props can modify it via state.

---

### **How to implement**

Now lets understand how do we implement this

### 📺 **Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?**

```jsx
// ParentComponent.js
import React from "react";
import ChildComponent from "./ChildComponent";

function ParentComponent() {
  const username = "Rahul";
  return <ChildComponent name={username} />;
}

export default ParentComponent;


// ChildComponent.js
import React from "react";

function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <h2>Welcome, {props.name}!</h2>;
}

export default ChildComponent;
```

---

> In this example, the `ParentComponent` passes the `username` as a prop named `name` to `ChildComponent`, which then displays it using `props.name`.

### \*_Some benefits of using props are :--_

✅ Props help in **making components reusable**.  
✅ Props **cannot be modified inside the child component**.  
✅ Props **allow components to communicate** with each other.

## 11. What is the difference between functional components and class-based components?

Ans :--

---

### **Need**

#### Why do we need to understand this difference?

React allows us to create components in two ways — one is **functional component** and other is using **class based components**.

---

### **What is it**

Ans :-- So the difference between **functional components** and **class-based components** is that

1. **Functional Components** - are simple JavaScript functions that take `props` as input and return JSX.  
   Earlier, they were called “stateless components”, but now with **React Hooks**, they can handle state and side effects too.
   While **class-based components** are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component` and must have a `render()` method to return JSX.

2. **Secondly**, functional components **use hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`** to manage state and lifecycle methods,which **simplifies state management and lifecycle methods** and makes the code cleaner and less complex whereas class-based components **use `this.state` for state** and have lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, to manage state and lifecycle of a component

3. **Thirdly**, functional components are **simpler, shorter, and better for performance** as they do not require class instances,
   while class-based components **are more complex** due to the `this` keyword and lifecycle methods, making them consume more memory and slightly **slower** as compared to funcitonal component.

4. **and functional components encourage code reusability**
   - With hooks, logic can be separated into **custom hooks**, making code **more reusable and maintainable**, while class-based components often lead to complex, hard-to-reuse logic.

### As a result,in modern React applications, **functional components with hooks** are preferred over class-based components.

---

### **How to implement**

#### Syntax & Key Differences

| Feature              | Functional Component             | Class Component                           |

| Syntax               | Function                         | Class extending `React.Component`         |
| State handling       | `useState` Hook                  | `this.state`                              |
| Lifecycle methods    | `useEffect` Hook                 | `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate` |
| `this` keyword usage | ❌ Not required                  | ✅ Required                               |
| Simpler to write     | ✅ Yes                           | ❌ More boilerplate                       |
| Performance          | ✅ Slightly better in most cases | ❌ Slightly heavier                       |
| Modern standard      | ✅ Preferred                     | ❌ Older style                            |

### 📺 **Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?**

```jsx
// FunctionalComponent.js

  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component mounted or updated");
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Functional Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default FunctionalComponent;
```

```jsx
// ClassComponent.js
import React, { Component } from "react";

class ClassComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

        <h2>Class Count: {this.state.count}</h2>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Increment
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ClassComponent;
```

> Functional components are now the **recommended approach** because of simplicity and the power of hooks.  
> Class components are still valid but mainly seen in older React codebases.

## 12. Advantages of using functional components over class-based components?

---

### **Need**

React allows us to create components in two ways — one is **functional component** and other is using **class based components**.
Before the introduction of hooks class components were the only way to manage state and lifecycle method . but
Class components had too much boilerplate and were harder to read and test.
So To solve this, React Hooks were introduced in React version 16.8, which gave functional components a lot of advantage .

Ans :-- So some of The advantages of **functional components** over **class-based components** are that

1.  **Functional Components** - are simple JavaScript functions that take `props` as input and return JSX.  
    Earlier, they were called “stateless components”, but now with **React Hooks**, they can handle state and side effects too.
    While **class-based components** are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component` and must have a `render()` method to return JSX.

2.  **Secondly**,- functional components **use hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`** to manage state and lifecycle methods,which **simplifies state management and lifecycle methods** and makes the code cleaner and less complex whereas class-based components **use `this.state` for state** and have lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate` to manage state and lifecycle of a component

3.  **Thirdly,**

    - functional components are **simpler, shorter, and better for performance** as they do not require class instances,
      while class-based components **are more complex** due to the `this` keyword and lifecycle methods, and they consume more memory and are slightly **slower** as compared to funcitonal component.

4.  **and functional components also encourage code reusability**
    - as With hooks, logic can be separated into **custom hooks**, making code **more reusable and maintainable**, while class-based components
      code are complex and hard to read .

### As a result,in modern React applications, **functional components with hooks** are preferred over class-based components.

## 13. Differentiate between stateful and stateless components in React?

---

Ans:--

### **Need**

#### Why do we need this distinction?

When building a React application, we deal with two kinds of components: first is a stateful component that **manage and hold data like taking interaction from user** (stateful), and the other one is stateless component that **just receive and display data** .

### **What** ?

The difference between **stateful** and **stateless** components is that:--

1. **Stateful components**

   - **manage their own state** using `this.state` in class components or the `useState` hook in functional components.
   - They **re-render** the whole component whenever the state changes.
   - For Example: A counter component that tracks a number.

2. On the other hand **Stateless components (also called Presentational Components or Dumb Components)**

   - **do not manage state**. They only just receive `props` and render the UI based on the props.
   - They are **pure functions**, meaning the same input (`props`) will always gives the same output.
   - Example: A component that displays a message.

3. **Lastly, Stateful components are more complex, while stateless components are simpler and reusable**
   - Stateful components **handle logic, user interaction, and state changes**.
   - Stateless components **focus only on UI rendering** and rely on `props` for dynamic content.

So, stateless components are preferred when possible for better performance and maintainability, while stateful components are used when dynamic behavior is needed. 🚀

### How ?

### 📺 **Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?**

```jsx
// StatefulComponent.js
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```jsx
// StatelessComponent.js
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h2>Hello, {name}!</h2>;
}
```

> `Counter` manages state = **stateful**  
> `Greeting` just takes props = **stateless**

# **(c)** _Functional Components & Hooks_

## Q14) What are Hooks?

---

### **Need**

Earlier, whenever we created a React component and needed to manage **state**, **lifecycle methods**, or handle **side-effects** , we had to use **class components**..

But the main downside of class based components was that they were complex, harder to read, and difficult to debug.

and so in order To solve these issues and enable us to use state and lifecycle features inside functional components, React introduced Hooks in version 16.8. which made the code **cleaner, reusable, and easier to understand**.

---

### **What**

#### What exactly are Hooks?

**Hooks** in React are special functions that **allow functional components to use
state and other React features** without writing a class based component.

#### Some of the Most commonly used hooks are:

1. **useState** – Allows functional components to manage state.
2. **useEffect** – Handles side effects like fetching data or updating the DOM.
3. **useContext** – Accesses global data without passing props manually.
4. **useRef** – Creates a reference to directly interact with DOM elements.
5. **useReducer** – Manages complex state logic like Redux but inside a component.

6. **useMemo** -

7. **useCallback** -

| Hook Name       | Purpose                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useState()`    | Add state to functional components                      |
| `useEffect()`   | Handle side effects (like API calls, DOM updates, etc.) |
| `useContext()`  | Access React Context API inside functional components   |
| `useRef()`      | Persist values across renders or access DOM elements    |
| `useReducer()`  | Alternative to `useState` for complex state logic       |
| `useMemo()`     | Memoize expensive calculations to optimize performance  |
| `useCallback()` | Memoize functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders     |

---

---

### **How**

### 📺 **Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?**

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component rendered or count changed");
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> In the above example:
>
> - `useState` adds state to the component
> - `useEffect` runs after each update — works like lifecycle methods

## Q15) Why not use a normal variable instead of `useState()` in React?

---

Ans:--

### **Need**

In a JavaScript apps, we can use `let` or `var` to store and update values . But In react ,The key difference is that React apps **re-render** when state changes, and **normal variables do not triggers re-renders**.
So If we use a regular variable, to store some data instead of useState hook .Then that data **gets reset every time our component re-renders**, and **also changes in that variable won’t trigger a re-render** . hence we will not be able to show the updated data in our UI .

So, when our goal is to **track dynamic values**(the value that is changing overtime) and reflect them in the UI, then normal variables won’t work and we have to use the useState hook.

---

### **What**

now let's understand the main difference between using a useState hook working and a normal varialbe

In React, every time a component **re-renders**, the function body is **executed again from top to bottom**.  
and any normal variables **get re-initialized** on every render .

As a result:

- Changes to normal variables **do not persist** across renders
- Updating them does **not cause a re-render**

But `useState` on The other hand solves both problems:

- it stores the value in the state (stores the value in React’s **internal memory**) so that it can persist across re-renders
- and also when we update the state using its setter method it **automatically triggers a re-render**

---

### **How**

### 📺 **Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  let normalCount = 0; // normal variable
  const [stateCount, setStateCount] = useState(0); // useState

  const handleClick = () => {
    normalCount++;
    setStateCount(stateCount + 1);
    console.log("Normal:", normalCount); // will reset to 0 every render
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Normal Count: {normalCount}</h3>
      <h3>State Count: {stateCount}</h3>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment Both</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> In this example:
>
> - `normalCount` **resets** to 0 on every render
> - `stateCount` keeps updating and triggers re-renders correctly

---

### **Conclusion**

✅ Use `useState` when you need to:

- **Persist values** across re-renders
- **Trigger re-renders** when the value changes

❌ Normal variables are lost after each render and do not trigger UI updates.

## 16. How to implement different lifecycle methods using `useEffect`?

### 🔍 **Need**

In class components, we had **lifecycle methods** like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.
but In **functional components**, we don't have lifecycle methods — so we have to use the `useEffect` hook to handle the life cycle methods.

---

### 📖 **What is it**

`useEffect` is a **React hook** that allows us to perform **side effects** in our functional components. As by default react function components are pure function .

So if we want `to do side effects` such as managing things outside the function’s scope like Fetching data from a server ,Setting up a timer or Listening to events then for this `we need to use the useEffect hook`.

useEffect hooks take two things in the argument one is a callback function and another is a dependancy array and If we return a function (return function) inside the callback, React treats that as a cleanup function. and uses it to clean up resources like clearing intervals or removing event listeners.

---

### 🛠️ **How to implement different lifecycle methods**

So Now lets understand how we achieve different lifecycle method by using useEffect hook

First we have `componentDidMount` and in order to use the lifecycle method of `componentDidMount` and to run the code only once when it gets mounted
we will pass an empty dependancy array to the useEffect hook this will make the code inside the call back function runs only once when it gets mounted for the first time.

2. Then we have `componentDidUpdate` (run whenever dependencies change)
   which run the code when the dependancy array changes, so in this we pass the value in the dependancy array and this make the code inside the callback function run two times one when it mounts and then whenever the value inside the dependacny array changes .

---

3. and lastly we can also achieve**`componentWillUnmount`** (cleanup before the component is removed)
   and for this we actually need a cleanup function inside our callback function
   for example when we want to clear a timer .

---

### 📺 **Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?**

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // componentDidMount
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Mounted ✅");
  }, []);

  // componentDidUpdate
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Count updated: ", count);
  }, [count]);

  // componentWillUnmount
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => setCount((c) => c + 1), 1000);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(id);
      console.log("Unmounted ⛔");
    };
  }, []);

  return <h1>{count}</h1>;
}
```

## 17. How does `useEffect`'s behavior change with its dependency array?

---

### 🔍 **Need**

When we use the `useEffect` hook , we use it to manage different lifecycle method and to run code at specific times so in order to do that we have the dependancy array which decides when should the useEffect hook run.

---

### 📖 **What is it**

`useEffect` is a **React hook** that allows us to perform **side effects** in our functional components. As by default react function components are pure function .

So if we want `to do side effects` such as managing things outside the function’s scope like Fetching data from a server ,Setting up a timer or Listening to events then for this `we need to use the useEffect hook`.

useEffect hooks take two things in the argument

1. one is a **callback function** inside which we write the side effect which we want to run.
2. and other is a **dependency array** that determines when the useEffect hook should re-run. and If we return a function (return function) inside the callback, React treats it as a cleanup function. and uses it to clean up resources like clearing intervals or removing event listeners.

### 🛠️ **How to implement**

#### **So there are three main ways that we can use the dependancy array**

- 1. First is when we pass an **Empty Dependency Array (`[]`)**: it mimics the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method in class components. and runs the callBack function inside the useEffect hook only when the component is mounted .

- 2.  **The other way is when we pass any value in the dependancy array (`[dep1, dep2]`)**:
      in this case the callback function runs two times one when the component is mounted just like `componentDidMount` and also whenever the value inside the dependacy array changes .which makes it equivalent to `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method of class component.

- 3. and lastly if pass no dependancy array then the callback function runs every time when the component is re-rendered.
     This behavior is equivalent to both `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`

---

### 📺 **Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?**

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const TimerComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState("John");

  // Effect with empty dependency array
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Mounted - runs only once!");
  }, []); // Runs only once

  // Effect with count as a dependency
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Count updated: ", count);
  }, [count]); // Runs whenever count changes

  // Effect with both count and name as dependencies
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Count or Name updated!");
  }, [count, name]); // Runs whenever either count or name changes

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <h2>Name: {name}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setName(name === "John" ? "Jane" : "John")}>
        Toggle Name
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default TimerComponent;
```

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `[]` (empty)               | Effect runs **only once**, after the initial render.                                       |

54. What does "debouncing" mean, and how can you implement it in React?

---

### 🔍 **Need**

In real-world applications, we often take input from users — for example, in a **search box** — we take userInput and show results based on that input. However, if we trigger an **API call** on every keystroke, it can lead to performance issues.

for example Suppose every time a user types something, it triggers an API call and If the user is typing fast, this could result in **multiple API calls** within a very short time, which will create unnecessary **network traffic** and can slow down the application.
So To solve this problem, we need a way to **delay** the function execution until the user stops typing. and for this purpose we need something known as debouncing.

---

### 📖 What is Debouncing?

Debouncing is a technique used to **delay the execution** of a function until a certain amount of time has passed after the last time it was called.This prevents unnecessary re-renders or API calls while the user is still typing.
for eg:--
It waits for the user to **stop typing** (or scrolling, etc.) for a specified time — and **then** triggers the function.

---

### 🛠️ How to implement in React

- `setTimeout` + `clearTimeout` inside `useEffect`

#### **How does debouncing work?**

1️⃣ We store the input value using `useState`.  
2️⃣ Every time the user types, we start a **timer (`setTimeout`)** to update the state **after a delay** (e.g., 500ms).  
3️⃣ If the user types again before the delay finishes, we **clear the previous timeout** and start a new one.  
4️⃣ This ensures that the function runs **only when the user stops typing for a while**.

We use `useEffect` to watch input changes and use `setTimeout` to delay the logic.

#### **How can we manage this using only `useState`?**

1️⃣ **Create a state to store the input value.**  
2️⃣ **Create another state to store the timeout ID.**  
3️⃣ Inside the input field's `onChange` event,

- **Clear the existing timeout using `clearTimeout`** (to reset the delay).
- **Start a new timeout (`setTimeout`)** and update the input state **only after the delay**.
- **Store the timeout ID in state** so that it can be cleared on the next keystroke.

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function SearchInput() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState("");
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(input);
    }, 500); // Delay of 500ms

    return () => clearTimeout(timer); // Cleanup on next keystroke
  }, [input]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (debouncedValue) {
      console.log("API call for:", debouncedValue);
      // You can trigger your API here
    }
  }, [debouncedValue]);

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      placeholder="Search..."
      value={input}
      onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
    />
  );
}
```

---

### 📺 Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?

- I will type in the input box.
- You'll see that the `console.log` (or API call) only fires **after I stop typing** for 500ms.
- This shows how **debounce reduces unnecessary function calls**.

---

### ✅ Pro Tip

- Debounce is perfect for **search bars, form validation, resize handlers** etc.
- You can also use **`lodash.debounce()`** if you want a cleaner syntax.

## 56.8) Explain how `useEffect` hook can be used as `componentDidMount` method ?

Ans :---

### **Need**

#### Why do we need to mimic `componentDidMount`?

In **class-based components**, we used `componentDidMount()` to **run code only once** when the component mounts — like calling an API, setting up listeners, etc.  
but In **functional components**, we don't have lifecycle methods — so we have to use the `useEffect` hook to handle the life cycle methods.

---

### **What is it**

#### What does "acting like `componentDidMount`" mean?

So in order to use the lifecycle method of `componentDidMount` and to run the code only once when it gets mounted we will use a useEffect and useEffect returns two things one is a callback function and another one is a dependancy array and using these two things we can achieve all the lifecycle method like the class component

like if we want to do something when the Component gets mounted and use the lifecycle method like componentDidMount then all we have to do is pass
an empty dependancy array and this will run the callback function when the component gets mount.

and when we pass no dependancy array then the callback function runs every time when the component is re-rendered.

and finally if we pass any value in the dependancy array then the callback function runs two times one when the component is mounted and other times whenever the value inside the dependacy array changes

### **How to implement**

### 📺 Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // This will run only once when the component mounts
    console.log("Component mounted");

    // You can call an API or perform setup here
  }, []); // 👈 empty array means run once

  return <h1>Hello from component</h1>;
}
```

---

> In this example, the `useEffect` with `[]` acts just like `componentDidMount` — it fetches data only once when the component first loads.

77. What is lazy loading and debouncing?

Ans :--

Perfect! This is again a **Type 1** style question. Let's answer it in a structured way — starting with **why we need them**, what they are, and their differences with **real-world examples** and **code snippets**.

---

## 27) What is **Lazy Loading** and **Debouncing** in JavaScript?

---

### 🔍 **Need**

In modern web development, we focus a lot on:

- **Performance optimization**
- **Reducing load time**
- **Avoiding unnecessary function calls**

Two techniques that help us with this are:
✅ **Lazy Loading**
✅ **Debouncing**

Let’s understand both one by one.

---

## ⚡ 1) Lazy Loading

### 📖 **Definition**

**Lazy Loading** is a technique where we **delay loading of a resource (like images, scripts, or components)** until they are **actually needed**.

Instead of loading everything upfront, we load **only what’s necessary** — and load the rest **on-demand**.

---

### 🧠 Think of it like:

> You don’t prepare all your clothes for the whole month in one go.
> You take out only **what you need today** — that’s lazy loading.

---

### 🧪 Example: Lazy load an image

```html
<img src="placeholder.jpg" loading="lazy" data-src="real-image.jpg" />
```

Or in JavaScript:

```js
const loadImage = () => {
  const img = document.querySelector("img");
  img.src = img.dataset.src;
};
```

### ✅ Use case:

- Improves **initial page load**
- Saves **bandwidth**
- Used in **React** for route-based component loading:

```js
const About = React.lazy(() => import("./About"));
```

---

## 🕒 2) Debouncing

### 📖 **Definition**

**Debouncing** is a technique used to **limit how often a function is called**, especially in **high-frequency events** like:

- `scroll`
- `resize`
- `input`/`search` typing

It ensures that the function runs **only after a pause** in activity.

---

### 🧠 Think of it like:

> You wait for someone to **stop talking** before you reply.
> If they keep typing, you hold on.
> You **respond only after they stop for a while**.

---

### 🧪 Example: Debounced search input

```js
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      fn.apply(this, args);
    }, delay);
  };
}

const handleSearch = debounce((e) => {
  console.log("Searching for", e.target.value);
}, 300);

document.getElementById("searchBox").addEventListener("input", handleSearch);
```

---

### ✅ Use case:

- Improves **performance**
- Avoids **API over-calling**
- Common in **search bars**, **window resize**, **auto-save**

---

## 🔄 **Lazy Loading vs Debouncing**

| Feature  | Lazy Loading                      | Debouncing                      |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Purpose  | Delay loading resources           | Delay function execution        |
| Use Case | Images, Components, Routes        | Typing, Resize, Scroll          |
| Goal     | Faster page load                  | Fewer function calls            |
| Trigger  | Load only when needed (on demand) | Wait for pause in user activity |

---

## 🔚 Conclusion:

- **Lazy Loading** is about **loading when needed**.
- **Debouncing** is about **waiting before running** a function.
- Both are used for **performance optimization** in different ways.

## Let me know if you want **throttling** explained too, which is closely related to debouncing.

79. What is Caching, and what are the different types of caching?

Ans :--

### 🔍 **Need**

In web applications, there is often a need to access the same data repeatedly (e.g., user info, product details, etc.). Fetching data from a **database** or an **API** every time can be **slow** and **inefficient**.

So ,We need a way to **store** this data temporarily for **faster access** — and that's where we need **caching** .

---

### 📖 What is Caching?

Caching is a **technique used to store data temporarily** so that it can be retrieved faster next time it's needed. Instead of repeatedly fetching data from a slow source (like a database or API), caching keeps it ready for quick access.

---

There are different types of caching based on where and how the data is stored.

### 🛠️ Some Types of Caching are:--

1. **Browser Cache**:

   - The browser stores certain resources (images, HTML, CSS) locally on the user's machine.
     **usage--**so that when we visit the website again the browser doesnot need to re-download those resource and can quickly load the page.

2. **Content Delivery Network (CDN) Cache**:

   - A CDN caches Stores content (images, videos, etc.) on servers located around the world close to the user’s location.
     **usage--** and then uses it to delivers the content quickly by serving it from the nearest server and hence improve the loading page.

3. **Database Cache**:

   - is used to store the result of frequently run database queries
     **usage--** and is used to reduce the number of queries to the database, which speed up response times and lower the database load.
   -

4. **Application Cache**:

   Application caches is used to Cache application data either on the **client-side** (e.g., using **localStorage**, or **sessionStorage**) or on the **server-side** (e.g., in-memory cache like Redis).
   **Usage:** and Helps store non-changing or user-specific data like preferences, tokens, or config settings, so it doesn't have to be fetched again and again.

---

### 📺 Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?

- I'll show a **browser caching example** in DevTools.
- Then, I’ll demonstrate **Redis caching** to speed up database queries.

---

### ✅ Pro Tip

- **Cache Invalidation**: Cache doesn't last forever. It needs to be **cleared or updated** when the data changes, otherwise stale data may be served.
- **Cache-Control** headers in HTTP responses are used to manage how and for how long resources are cached in browsers and CDNs.

## 80. what is throttling ?

Ans :---Great! Here's how you'd answer this **Type 1** question about **throttling** in JavaScript — in a clean, structured, and easy-to-speak format 👇

---

## 80) What is **Throttling** in JavaScript?

---

### 🔍 **Need for Throttling**

In real-world web apps, some events like:

- `scroll`
- `resize`
- `mousemove`

...can fire **hundreds of times per second**.

➡️ This can **slow down the app** if you call a function every time the event fires.

That’s where **throttling** helps!

---

### 🧠 What is Throttling?

> ✅ **Throttling** is a technique used to **limit how often a function is called**.

It ensures that the function runs **only once in a specified time interval**, even if the event occurs **multiple times**.

---

### 📦 Think of it like:

> "You can press the elevator button **many times**, but it only **responds once every 2 seconds**."

---

### 📚 Example:

```js
function throttle(func, delay) {
  let lastCall = 0;

  return function (...args) {
    const now = new Date().getTime();

    if (now - lastCall >= delay) {
      lastCall = now;
      func.apply(this, args);
    }
  };
}
```

Usage:

```js
function onScroll() {
  console.log("Scrolling...");
}

window.addEventListener("scroll", throttle(onScroll, 1000)); // runs once every 1 sec
```

---

### 🔄 Difference between **Throttling** and **Debouncing**:

| Feature      | Debouncing                        | Throttling                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Timing       | Waits till the last event fires   | Runs at regular intervals        |
| Use case     | `Search input`, `Auto-save`       | `Scroll`, `Resize`, `Mouse move` |
| Delay resets | Every event call resets the timer | Timer runs independently         |

---

### 📌 In Summary:

> ✅ **Throttling** limits how often a function runs, improving performance by preventing too many executions in short time.

## **(c)** Hooks topics and routing question (Refer wo hooks video for hooks baaki khud se)------------

### Q14) Explain the concept of Lifting State up ?

Ans :--

### Q0) What is React router Dom and is it Different from React-router ?What happpend after the version 7 update to them ?

### Q0.1) What is Link and Navlink component provided by React-Router ?

### Q1) what is useState Hook ?and why we need state why can't we just use variable ?

Ans :--

### Q2) What is useEffect hook ?

Ans :--

(Example with a cleanup function) --- For example we want to show what is the current width of the window screen whenever we are resizing then we will use useEffect

```js
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function WindowResizeTracker() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);

    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);

    return () => {
      console.log("Cleanup: Removing resize listener");
      window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Window Width: {width}px</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default WindowResizeTracker;
```
