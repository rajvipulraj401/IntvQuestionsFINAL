### _React Basics & Core Concepts_

### Q1) What is React?

**Ans :--**

---

**Need (Why do we need React?)**

So when we make big websites or web apps, there are many parts that keep changing â€” like showing new messages, updating buttons, hiding or showing content based on user actions, etc.

Now if we try to do this with just plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it becomes very messy and hard to manage.
So Thatâ€™s why we need React

**What (What is React?)**----

So, React is an open source front end **JavaScript library** which is used to build **user interfaces**, especially for **single-page applications**. It is helpful
in building complex application as it follows the component based approach and divides the whole page into small reusable components and makes it **easy to update just the parts that changes** without refreshing the whole page.

Some key features of react are :-

1. React uses jsx syntax (whuch combines js and Html)
2. It uses virtual dom instead of Real DOM
3. It follows unidirectional from paret to child which simplify the data management.
4. It supports server side rendering which is useful for Seo.

## ðŸ“º Sir can I share my screen to show this with an example

ðŸ–¥ _Let me share my screen and show you how a simple React component looks like:_

```jsx
// App.js
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  const name = "React";

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
      <p>This is a basic React component using JSX.</p>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

2. What is JSX?

Ans :--

Perfect! Hereâ€™s your answer for:

---

### Q2) What is JSX?

Ans :--

---

**Need (Why do we need JSX?)**

whenever we build React apps, we need to mix **HTML and JavaScript** to show dynamic data in the UI.  
and earlier we had to do that using `document.createElement()` which was **complex and less readable** . So inorder To solve this problem, **React introduced JSX** .

---

**What (What exactly is JSX?)**

JSX stands for **JavaScript XML**. It allows us to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript and place them in the Dom without using functions like **append child** or **create element**
Basically it just provide us the syntatic sugar for the `react. createElement (types, props , ..children)` and it makes the code more readable and expressive by combining JavaScript expressions
with an HTML-like template syntax .

`EXTRA dont speak`
But JSX doesnâ€™t work directly in the browser â€” React converts it behind the scenes to `React.createElement()` calls.
In short â€” JSX makes React code **look like HTML**, but itâ€™s still JavaScript.

---

**How (How do we use JSX and what are the rules?)**

some important **rules** OF JSX that we need to follow are:

1. **All JSX tags must be closed**, even self-closing ones.

for eg:--

```jsx
<img src="logo.png" /> // âœ… valid in JSX
```

2. **All Attribute nameing should be in camelCase**.

   - Use `className` instead of `class`
   - Use `onClick` instead of `onclick`

3. **Use curly braces `{}` to write JS expressions inside JSX**.

   ```jsx
   const name = "React";
   <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;
   ```

4. **JSX should only return one parent element so Wrap multiple elements inside one parent** (either a `<div>` or a React fragment `<>...</>`).
   ```jsx
   return (
     <>
       <h1>Hello</h1>
       <p>World</p>
     </>
   );
   ```

---

## ðŸ“º Sir can I share my screen to show this with an example

ðŸ–¥ Sir let me share my screen and show a small example of how JSX works in React.

```jsx
// App.js
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  const username = "Crio Learner";

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello {username}</h1>
      <p>This is JSX in action inside a React component.</p>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

3. What is Virtual DOM in React?
4. What is the difference between Virtual DOM and Real DOM in React?
5. What is reconciliation in React?
6. What is the need of ReactJS if we already have HTML, CSS, JS, or jQuery?
7. What is a Single Page Application (SPA)? âœ…

---

### Q5) what is a singlepage application ?

Ans:--
**Need? ---**
So, whenever we build a website or a project, we need to implement multiple pages. Usually, websites have different sections, like in a **navbar**, where we see different options linking to various pages.

In a traditional **Multi-Page Application (MPA)**, clicking on a link reloads the entire page, which slows down performance. This happens because every time we navigate to a different page, the browser fetches and loads a completely new HTML file.

To solve this, **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** were introduced, especially after **React** became popular.

**What is an SPA?**

A Single Page Application is a web application where we have only **one main HTML file**, and all other content is dynamically loaded inside it without refreshing the page. Instead of fetching a new HTML file, it only updates specific sections, making the app feel much faster.
**How do we handle multiple pages inside an SPA?**

We achieve this using **React Router**, which is a library in React that allows us to create multiple sections (or views) within the same page. When we click on a link, instead of reloading the page, it just updates the view by changing the route.

**Steps to implement an SPA:**

1. Use **React (a JavaScript library)** to build the application.
2. Use **React Router** to handle different routes within the same page.

This is how we create a smooth, fast, and efficient **Single Page Application (SPA).**

### Q2) Explain the concept of Lifting State up ?

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

## **(c)** Hooks topics and routing question (Refer wo hooks video for hooks baaki khud se)------------

### Q0) What is React router Dom and is it Different from React-router ?What happpend after the version 7 update to them ?

### Q0.1) What is Link and Navlink component provided by React-Router ?

### Q1) what is useState Hook ?and why we need state why can't we just use variable ?

Ans :--

### Q2) What is useEffect hook ?

Ans :--

(Example with a cleanup function) --- For example we want to show what is the current width of the window screen whenever we are resizing then we will use useEffect

```js
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function WindowResizeTracker() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);

    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);

    return () => {
      console.log("Cleanup: Removing resize listener");
      window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Window Width: {width}px</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default WindowResizeTracker;
```

### Q3) What is useRef hooks?
