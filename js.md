# **(A)** _Basic :--------_

### Q0) what is js ?what are different ways you can write js ? what tag we use to define inline js and internal js and external js and what tag we use to link external js file in html ?

## Q0) What is JavaScript?

Ans :--  
(generate the need)

---

### **Need (Why do we need JavaScript?)**

When we build web pages using just HTML and CSS, we can only build **static websites** ‚Äî like headings, paragraphs, buttons, etc. But if we want to interact with the page ‚Äî like responding to clicks or fetching data from a server

we cannot do that and in order to do that in our website and make it **interactive and dynamic**, we need to use JavaScript.

---

### **What (What exactly is JavaScript?)**

JavaScript is a **high-level** ( code that's close to normal english and not like low level which is close to machine like C OR C++), **interpreted programming language** (A code which run line by line by something called an interpreter and is not compiled into machine language (thats why usually slower than compiled language but FASTER to debug and test))
`that runs **inside the browser**. It allows us to **create dynamic and interactive web pages**.`

<!-- ye pdho neeche üëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèº -->

JavaScript is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** that runs **inside the browser**. It allows us to **create dynamic and interactive web pages**.

Using JS, we can:

- Modify HTML and CSS dynamically
- and Respond to user actions like (clicks, timer, fetching data etc.)

So whatever we want to show when a user does some interaction with our website for that we need javascript .
we can understand this by a real word analogy of a car so the parts of the car are like html and the design and size of parts are css and the engine is Javascript .

---

### **How (How do we use JavaScript in a project?)**

### üì∫ Sir can I share my screen to show this with an example

So There are **three main ways** to add JavaScript to an HTML page:

---

1. First we have **Inline JavaScript**  
    In this JS is written directly inside an element using the `onclick` or similar event attributes.

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8" />
       <title>Inline JS Example</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Inline JavaScript Demo</h1>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

  <!-- ‚úÖ Inline JS inside the onclick attribute -->

<button onclick="alert('Bhai, inline JS chal gaya!')">Click Me</button>

</body>
</html>
```

---

2. Then we have the **Internal JavaScript**
   In this We write JavaScript inside a `<script>` tag in the HTML document usually at the bottom of <body>.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Internal JS Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome, Bhai!</h1>
    <button id="clickBtn">Click Me</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

  <!-- ‚úÖ Internal JS at the end of body -->
  <script>
    <!-- // JavaScript yahan likha gaya hai ‚Äî DOM ke baad chalega -->

    document.getElementById("clickBtn").addEventListener("click", function () {
      alert("Bhai, button click ho gaya!");
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
   ```

---

3. **External JavaScript (Most Recommended)**  
   We write JavaScript in a separate `.js` file and link it using the `<script src="">` tag.

   ```html
   <script type="module" src="script.js"></script>
   ```

   <!-- (module auto defer krta hai aur isme imprt export ka feature bhi hota hai ) -->

   In `script.js`:

   ```js
   function greet() {
     alert("Hello from external JS file!");
   }
   ```

## 16) What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?

---

### üü¢ **Similarity**

In JavaScript `==` and `===` are **comparison operators** used for comparison, but they differ in how they compare values.

---

Note - In case of Non primitive == and === will just the reference so both will return false for example []==[] (this will be false ) and also []===[] (this will also be false kyunki diff reference memory
location is different where this object /array is stored)

### üîÄ **Difference between `==` and `===`**

1. **Type Coercion**

   - `==`: Performs type coercion and converts values to a common type before comparison.
   - while `===`: Does not perform type coercion. It checks for both value and type equality.

2. **Strictness**
   - `==`: is Known as the **loose or abstract equality** operator as It allows equality comparison after type conversion.
   - and `===`: is Known as the **strict equality** operator as It requires both values and type to be same .

---

### üì∫ Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?

```js
// Using ==
console.log(5 == "5"); // true ‚Üí because it converts "5" to 5

// Using ===
console.log(5 === "5"); // false ‚Üí number and string are different types

// Another example
console.log(null == undefined); // true
console.log(null === undefined); // false
```

> So, use `===` when you want **strict and safer comparison**.  
> And avoid `==` unless you know exactly how coercion will behave.

Of course bhai! Ye question **‚ÄúExplain‚Ä¶‚Äù** type hai, so I‚Äôm using your **Format 1** ‚Äî with proper flow: need ‚Üí what ‚Üí how ‚Üí code. Simple English, interview tone üëá

---

## 19) Explain Hoisting in JS

---

### üîç **Need**

In JavaScript, sometimes variables or functions work even **before** they are even declared in the code as we can access them .This is known as **hoisting**.

---

### üìñ **What is it**

**Hoisting** in javascript is a phenomena where a variable declared with var keyword and function declaration are **move to the top of the code** and only the variable declaration is hoisted to the top not the initialization which basically means that we can access them even before they are declared.
It leads to bugs and problems in code .
For example if we try to print a variable a which is decalred using var even before its declaration we will get undefined as output as only the declaration part is moved to the Top not the initialization .

So in order to tackle the issues caused by hoisting, ES6 introduced two new keywords for declaring variables: let and const. what happens is that When variables are declared using let and const, they are also hoisted, but they enter a ‚Äútemporal dead zone‚Äù (TDZ) from the start of the block until the declaration is encountered. This means you cannot access them before their declaration, and attempting to do so will result in a ReferenceError.

```javascript
console.log(a); // Output: undefined
var a = 5;
```

The above code should be visualized like this so that why we get undefined .

```javascript
var a;
console.log(a);
a = 5;
```

- **Output:** `undefined` because `var a;` is hoisted to the top, but the assignment happens later.

### Hoisting with `let` and `const`:

```javascript
console.log(a);
let a = 10;
```

- **Output:** `ReferenceError`(reference error as we cannot access it before initialization )
  because even though`let` and `const` are hoisted too, but they are in a **"temporal dead zone"**, so accessing them before declaration throws an error.

### ---------**\***EXTRA STARTS HERE**\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***----------

`Extra --Variables declared with let and const are in what's called the Temporal Dead Zone from the start of the block until the line where they are declared.So if you try to access them before the actual declaration line, JavaScript will throw a ReferenceError.`

##### ex 3--

```javascript
func();
function func() {
  console.log("hello"); //  Hello   Because the entire function is hoisted at the top
}
```

Note - function declaration is hoisted entirely . (other function is hoisted partially (IT MEANS ONLY VARIABLE IS HOISTED AND uska type nahi pata ki wo variable function hai so if we call that function it will throw TypeError not undefined because we are making undefined call as function so this leads to error as we cannot make funciton call on undefined.) only if the function is declared using var cause of only declaration hoisted at top in var keyword and not assignment and if the function expression or arrow function is declared using let or const it will not be hoisted .(because let and const are not hoisted )

#### Function Hoisting

##### 1. **Function Declarations**:

- **Entirely Hoisted**: Function declarations are hoisted entirely to the top of their scope. This means you can call the function before its declaration in the code.
- **Example**:

  ```javascript
  console.log(myFunction()); // Works because myFunction is hoisted

  function myFunction() {
    return "Hello, world!";
  }
  ```

- **Example 2**:

```javascript
console.log(myFunction); // undefined, because only the declaration is hoisted
myFunction(); // TypeError: myFunction is not a function
var myFunction = function () {
  return "Hello, world!";
};
```

##### Explanation:

1. **Hoisting**: In JavaScript, variable declarations (but not initializations) are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means that the declaration of `myFunction` is hoisted, but its assignment (`function() { return "Hello, world!"; }`) is not.

2. **First `console.log(myFunction)`**: At this point, `myFunction` is declared but not yet assigned, so it logs `undefined`.

3. **Calling `myFunction()`**: Since `myFunction` is `undefined` at this point, trying to call it results in a `TypeError`, not a `ReferenceError`. The error message will be: `TypeError: myFunction is not a function`.

4. **Assignment**: After the assignment, `myFunction` becomes a function that returns `"Hello, world!"`.

#### 2. **Function Expressions and Arrow Functions**:

- **Hoisted Partially with `var`**: If a function expression is declared using `var`, only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the assignment.

- **Not Hoisted with `let` or `const`**: If a function expression or arrow function is declared using `let` or `const`, it is not hoisted.
- **Example**:

  ```javascript
  console.log(myFunction); // ReferenceError, because let and const are not hoisted

  let myFunction = () => {
    return "Hello, world!";
  };
  ```

#### Special Case with Function Expressions:

```javascript
funcExp();
var funcExp = function display() {
  console.log("Will this work?");
};
```

- **Output:** `TypeError` because `funcExp` is hoisted as `undefined`, but the function is not assigned yet.

---

### ---------**\***EXTRA ends HERE**\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***----------

> In simple terms:  
> ‚úÖ Variable and function **declarations are hoisted**,  
> ‚ùå but **initializations/assignments are NOT**.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **How to implement / see it**

---

### üì∫ Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?

```js
// Function hoisting works fine
greet(); // Output: Hello

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

// Variable hoisting
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 10;

// But let/const variables are hoisted in a different way
console.log(y); // ‚ùå ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
let y = 20;
```

---

> ‚úÖ Function declarations are fully hoisted (you can call them before defining).  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è `var` is hoisted but its **value is `undefined`** until it is initialized.

## 20) What are Closures in JavaScript?

---

### üîç **Need**

when we are building a counter kind of application in javascript that counts everytime a button gets clicked .

So to count the number of clicks we might want to store a variable in global scope so that whenever the button is clicked we update the count variable but the problem in this is that if we create a variable in the global variable that global counter variable can be changed from outside from any script on the page or even from just the browser.

and also if we declare the count variable insida a function that function will reset the count variable every time we call that function .

and So in order to create a variable that **remembers its value** but is still **protected** from outside source ? we need something known as **Closures**

---

### üìñ **What is a Closure?**

Function + lexical Environment .
A **closure** is a `combination of a function and its lexical environment`. It allows a function to access variables from its outer scope, even after the outer function has returned.
It **remembers the environment** in which it was created ‚Äî this allows us to create **private variables** and maintain state.

---

### **How** ?

### üì∫ Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?

```js
// Closure Example
const clickCounter = (function () {
  let counter = 0; // private variable

  return function () {
    counter++;
    console.log("Total clicks:", counter);
  };
})();

clickCounter(); // Total clicks: 1
clickCounter(); // Total clicks: 2
clickCounter(); // Total clicks: 3
```

```javascript
function parent() {
  const msg = "I am from function parent";
  function child() {
    console.log(msg + " called from child function");
  }
  return child;
}
let result = parent();
result(); // Output: I am from function parent called from child function
```

Here, the inner function still has access to the `counter` variable, even though the outer function has already executed ‚Äî this is closure in action.

---

> ‚úÖ Closures help you **preserve data privately** and **maintain state** without relying on global variables.

---

### **EXTRAS---**

NoteQ) BUT HOW CAN WE ACCESSING THIS msg variable here ???

Answer -- Cause when we are returning the function we are not only returning the function we are also returning its lexical environment so that's why the variable which were accessible in it .

The `child` function remembers its lexical scope (the `msg` variable) even after the `parent` function has returned.

So In conclusion

If a function is created inside another function , it retains access to the scope of that outer function function even after that outer function returns , because the outer function is in the lexical scope of the inner function .

---

Q) How closures are formed in javascripts?

**Need for Closures:**

- Closures are a powerful feature of JavaScript, enabling function encapsulation and private data management.
- They are fundamental to functional programming in JavaScript and are crucial for writing efficient and modular code.

**How Closures are Used:**

- Closures are often used to create private variables or functions.
- Since JavaScript doesn‚Äôt have built-in support for private variables, closures can encapsulate variables, making them accessible only to certain functions.
- This is useful for data encapsulation and object data privacy.
- Closures are also used in event handling, callbacks, and maintaining state in asynchronous operations.

Ans --- vvimp

### Practical Example of Closures:

```javascript
function multiply(storedNum) {
  return function (num) {
    return storedNum * num;
  };
}

const multiplyTwo = multiply(2);
const multiplyThree = multiply(3);
const multiplyFour = multiply(4);

console.log(multiplyTwo(5)); // 10
console.log(multiplyThree(6)); // 18
console.log(multiplyFour(7)); // 24
```

Explanation -- The above is returning a function and the below is calling that function as now the other varaible has the access to the returned function so it can call using its own name(`in this case multiplyTwo()` ab us variable me function return hoke aaya`).and access the parent function due to having the access of its lexical scope due to closure.

Note --The inner function returned by `multiply` retains access to `storedNum` due to closures.

## 21) Differentiate between `map()`, `filter()` and `reduce()` in JavaScript

---

### ‚úÖ **Similarity**

All three ‚Äî `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` ‚Äî are **array methods** in JavaScript. which are used to perform array operations. They follow the declarative programming approach where we just specify what we want rather than imperative .

### üîÑ **Difference between `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`**

There are some difference in how we use them

| Feature             | `map()`                                | `filter()`                              | `reduce()`                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**         | Transforms each element of the array   | Filters elements based on a condition   | Reduces the array to a single value          |
| **Return Type**     | Returns a **new array** of same length | Returns a **new array** (maybe shorter) | Returns a **single value** (can be anything) |
| **Callback Output** | Callback must return transformed value | Callback must return `true` or `false`  | Callback must return accumulated result      |
| **Original Array**  | Not mutated                            | Not mutated                             | Not mutated                                  |
| **Use Case**        | Changing values in array (e.g. square) | Filtering users, items, etc.            | Summing numbers, grouping data, etc.         |

---

### üì∫ Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// map ‚Üí Multiply each number by 2
const mapped = arr.map((num) => num * 2); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

// filter ‚Üí Keep only even numbers
const filtered = arr.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]

// reduce ‚Üí Find sum of all numbers
const reduced = arr.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0); // 15

console.log(mapped, filtered, reduced);
```

---

> ‚úÖ Use `map()` when you want to **transform** data.  
> ‚úÖ Use `filter()` when you want to **select** specific items.  
> ‚úÖ Use `reduce()` when you want to **summarize or combine** everything into one result.

## 26.0) What is shallow copy deep copy in JavaScript?

---

### üîç **Need**

in JavaScript, when we copy an object or an array, sometimes the changes in the copied version also affect the original one. ‚Äî which is not expected. and in order to understand why this happens, we need to understand the **difference between shallow copy and deep copy**.

---

### üìñ **What is it**

A **shallow copy** means copying just the reference of the variable which is holding the address of **non-primitive data type** and in case of object it means copying only the **top-level properties** and If the object contains nested objects, those are **still shared** between the original and the copy.
. On the other hand **deep copy** means creating a new object(array or object) and then manually copying each element of that object into it so that changing the copied object do not change the original object .

**Note** ---`In js we can use spread operator to solve shallow copying problem for the first layer of the objects but if the object is deeply nested then for this we have to use Object.stringify and Object.Parse and some other libraries like Lodas because spread operator also does shallow copying in the case of nested object as it just copies the reference of them.`

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **How to implement**

### üì∫ Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?

```js
const obj1 = { arun: 1, boy: { cat: 2 } };

// Shallow Copy using spread
const shallow = { ...obj1 };

// Deep Copy using JSON
const deep = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1));

shallow.boy.cat = 100;
console.log(obj1.boy.cat); // 100 (shallow copy affected original)

deep.boy.cat = 200;
console.log(obj1.boy.cat); // 100 (deep copy didn‚Äôt affect original)
```

---

> ‚úÖ Use **shallow copy** when you‚Äôre sure the object has no nested structure.  
> ‚úÖ Use **deep copy** when your object has **nested objects/arrays** and you want full independence.

## 50. Explain the differences between localStorage and Session Storage.

Ans:--

### Similarity first

Both **localStorage** and **sessionStorage** are part of the **Web Storage API** They allow us to store data in the browser in key-value pairs. ‚ÄîThey are often used to store data like: user preferences , tokens .

### Then diff

But There are some **key differences** between them

---

1. **The first major difference is that .**

   - The `localStorage` stores data **permanently** ‚Äî unless we remove it manually or the browser cache is cleared.
   - But `sessionStorage` stores data **only for that specific tab session** ‚Äî and the data gets cleared automatically when the tab is closed.

---

2. **Secondly, their usage across tabs is different.**

   - Data in `localStorage` is **shared across all tabs** of the same origin (website). So if you open multiple tabs of the same site, they can all access the same localStorage data.
   - But `sessionStorage` is **tab-specific** ‚Äî each tab has its own sessionStorage, and it‚Äôs not shared between tabs.

---

3. **Thirdly, both store data as strings ‚Äî but there‚Äôs a difference in intent.**

   - Use `localStorage` when you want to store data like theme, auth token, or user preferences that should be **available even after refreshing or reopening the browser**.
   - Use `sessionStorage` when you want to keep temporary data like form values or one-time user flow data that **should reset on tab close**.

---

4. **Also, both have a storage limit of around 5MB** ‚Äî but that can vary a bit depending on the browser.

---

### üì∫ Sir, can I share my screen to show this with an example?

```js
// Storing data
localStorage.setItem("user", "John");
sessionStorage.setItem("token", "abc123");

// Getting data
console.log(localStorage.getItem("user")); // "John"
console.log(sessionStorage.getItem("token")); // "abc123"

// Removing data
localStorage.removeItem("user");
sessionStorage.removeItem("token");
```

> üëâ So the key difference is:  
> localStorage = long-term across tabs,  
> sessionStorage = short-term and tab-specific.
