### Q0) What is JavaScript?

Ans :--  
(generate the need)

**Need (Why do we need JavaScript?)**

When we build web pages using just HTML and CSS, we can only build **static websites** — like headings, paragraphs, buttons, etc. But if we want to interact with the page — like responding to clicks or fetching data from a server

we cannot do that and in order to do that in our website and make it **interactive and dynamic**, we need to use JavaScript.

**What (What exactly is JavaScript?)**

JavaScript is a **high-level** ( code that's close to normal english and not like low level which is close to machine like C OR C++), **interpreted programming language** (A code which run line by line by something called an interpreter and is not compiled into machine language (thats why usually slower than compiled language but FASTER to debug and test))
`that runs **inside the browser**. It allows us to **create dynamic and interactive web pages**.`

JavaScript is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** that runs **inside the browser**. It allows us to **create dynamic and interactive web pages**.

Using JS, we can:

- Modify HTML and CSS dynamically
- and Respond to user actions like (clicks, timer, fetching data etc.)

So whatever we want to show when a user does some interaction with our website for that we need javascript .
we can understand this by a real word analogy of a car so the parts of the car are like html and the design and size of parts are css and the engine is Javascript .

**How (How do we use JavaScript in a project?)**

So There are **three main ways** to add JavaScript to an HTML page:

---

1. First we have **Inline JavaScript**  
    In this JS is written directly inside an element using the `onclick` or similar event attributes.

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8" />
       <title>Inline JS Example</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Inline JavaScript Demo</h1>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

  <!-- ✅ Inline JS inside the onclick attribute -->

<button onclick="alert('Bhai, inline JS chal gaya!')">Click Me</button>

</body>
</html>
```

---

2. Then we have the **Internal JavaScript**
   In this We write JavaScript inside a `<script>` tag in the HTML document usually at the bottom of <body>.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Internal JS Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome, Bhai!</h1>
    <button id="clickBtn">Click Me</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

  <!-- ✅ Internal JS at the end of body -->
  <script>
    <!-- // JavaScript yahan likha gaya hai — DOM ke baad chalega -->

    document.getElementById("clickBtn").addEventListener("click", function () {
      alert("Bhai, button click ho gaya!");
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
   ```

---

3. **External JavaScript (Most Recommended)**  
   We write JavaScript in a separate `.js` file and link it using the `<script src="">` tag.

   ```html
   <script type="module" src="script.js"></script>
   ```

   <!-- (module auto defer krta hai aur isme imprt export ka feature bhi hota hai ) -->

   In `script.js`:

   ```js
   function greet() {
     alert("Hello from external JS file!");
   }
   ```
