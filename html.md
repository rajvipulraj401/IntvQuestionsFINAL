### Q0) What is HTML?

Ans :--
(generate the need)

**Need :--**

When we want to build any website or web application, we need a way to add structore to our website —like headings, paragraphs, images, forms, buttons, etc. as Without a structure, the browser won’t understand how to display the elements properly.
So in order to do that we have Html

**What :--**

So HTML stands for hyper text markup language and it used to define the structure and content of our webpage . This like the skeleton of our webpage .
It allows us to define various elements like heading , paragraph etc.
Html have 4 key elements inside which all the other elements are defined

1. doctype
2. root html element
3. head element
4. body element

**How:---**

Sir can i share my screen to show this with an example (NOT needed in this question)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta
      name="description"
      content="A simple HTML page with heading, paragraph, image, and a link."
    />
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />
    <!-- CSS file link (optional) -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML page with a heading and paragraph.</p>
    <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Profile Photo" />
    <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Visit Google</a>

    <!-- JS file link -->
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

So this is how we create an HTML document file (**Boiler plate banao**)

### Q1) How does the browser loads HTML and JS files upon visiting a particular website? (crio)

Ans -- When we visit a website, the process of loading HTML and JavaScript files, along with other resources like CSS and images, is a multi-step process that involves both wer web browser and the web server hosting the website.

**DNS Lookup**: The first step is DNS Lookup in which the browser finds the IP address of the website we're trying to visit.

and then After getting the IP, the browser connects to the server via TCP/IP (often using HTTPS for secure communication).

**HTTP Request**: then in the next step is Request for HTML file using HTTP reuest in this The browser sends a GET request to the server asking for the HTML file.

**Server Response & Parsing**: And then the Server responds with the HTML file and then the browser starts parsing it line by line from top to bottom .
and it then loads the css and javascript files ( and if theere is no aync or defer tag the browser stops HTML parsing and it starts downloading and executing javascript file where it finds .)

If async is used, JS is downloaded and executed as soon as it's ready (even if HTML is still parsing).

If defer is used, JS is downloaded in parallel but executed after HTML is fully parsed.

**Execution and Rendering**: Finally after loading all the resource the browser builds the DOM from HTML and applies styles and javascript and renders the website on the screen .

### Q2) What is the purpose of the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration in HTML documents?(crio)

## Ans :--

---

**Need (Why do we need `<!DOCTYPE>` in HTML?)**

When we create a webpage, we want all browsers to interpret and render our HTML Page **consistently**. But some older browsers can render our page differently if they don’t know what version of HTML we’re using. so in order to tell the browser what version of html we are using we use Doctype declaration .

> Without this declaration, browsers might switch to **quirks mode**, which can break the layout and styling.

---

**What (What exactly is `<!DOCTYPE>`?)**

- So `<!DOCTYPE>` is a **declaration**, not an HTML tag.
- and It appears **at the very top** of our HTML file.
- and It tells the browser **which version of HTML** the page is using.

for example In HTML 5 development, we use:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

This tells the browser to render the page using **HTML5**.

---

extra (do not need to say)
**How (How does it work & what happens without it?)**

- When the browser sees `<!DOCTYPE html>`, it **enters standards mode**, where it follows all modern HTML and CSS rules strictly.
- If it's missing or written incorrectly, the browser may fall into **quirks mode**, which tries to mimic old, non-standard behavior for backward compatibility.

  In quirks mode:

  - Layouts can break.
  - CSS might behave inconsistently.
  - It becomes hard to debug or maintain the site.

So, always including `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the top is a **best practice** to ensure your site looks and behaves correctly across all modern browsers.

---

### Q3) What does an HTML document consist of?

Answer ----An HTML document consists of four main parts Doctype Declaration , root element , head element and Body element .

1. **Doctype Declaration**: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML. It ensures the browser knows to render the page in standards mode.

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   ```

2. **Root Element**: The `<html>` tag is the root element that wraps all the content of the HTML document.

   ```html
   <html></html>
   ```

3. **Head Element**: This section includes meta-information about the document, such as:

   - **Title**: The title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.
   - **Meta Tags**: Information about the webpage, like character set, author, and description.
   - **Links to Stylesheets**: External CSS files that style the webpage.
   - **Scripts**: JavaScript files that add interactivity to the webpage.

4. **Body Element**: This section contains the actual content of the webpage, such as:
   - **Text**: Paragraphs, headings, and lists.
   - **Images**: Pictures and graphics.
   - **Links**: Hyperlinks to other webpages.
   - **Forms**: Input fields, buttons, and other form elements.
   - **Multimedia**: Videos and audio files.

### Q5) How to Create a Hyperlink in HTML?

Ans -HTML provides an anchor tag (`<a>`) to create hyperlinks that link one page to another. The syntax for creating a hyperlink is:

```html
<a href="URL">Link Text</a>
```

These tags can appear in any of the following ways:

- **Unvisited Link**: Displayed as underlined and blue.
- **Visited Link**: Displayed as underlined and purple.
- **Active Link**: Displayed as underlined and red.

---

Also

hyperlinks can be applied to both text and images.

let me share my screen to show it

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image" />
</a>
```

Q29) How do we create links to different sections within the same HTML web page?

Intv Ans --  
To create links to different sections within the same HTML web page, we use an anchor tag (`<a>`) combined with an `id` attribute. This technique is often referred to as creating “anchor links” or “bookmarks.”

In order to do that we add an `id` Attribute to the Target Section where we want to go and then we use the anchor tag and inside its href attribut we write # and its id name to link it to that id section.

here how we do:

1. **Add an `id` Attribute to the Target Section**: Assign a unique `id` to the section you want to link to.
2. **Create a Link to the Target Section**: Use the `href` attribute in an anchor tag with a `#` followed by the `id` value of the target section.

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Page with Internal Links</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Links -->
    <a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>

    <!-- Sections -->
    <h2 id="section1">Section 1</h2>
    <p>This is Section 1.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, clicking on "Go to Section 1" will scroll the page to the element with `id="section1"`.
