## **1.1) Why you leave your previous company ? [ ✅]**

Ans :--
**"I worked as a front-end intern where the company was focused on Web3, but my work mostly involved with frontEnd. After the internship, they were ready to take me forward in the hiring process, but due to some health issues at that time, I couldn't accept the offer. So I decided to use that time to upskill myself and I joined Crio to improve my web development and DSA skills and to get better prepared for future job opportunities."**

**"After my front-end internship, the HR spoke to me and showed interest in continuing with me. It was more of a verbal conversation, and they asked me to take some time to think about it.
